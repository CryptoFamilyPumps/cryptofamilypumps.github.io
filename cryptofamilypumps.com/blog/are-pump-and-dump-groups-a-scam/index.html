		<p><strong> </strong>There have been a number of things said about pump and dump groups in recent times, some of it is positive while other reports are not so favorable. So, this ultimately leads to a question as to whether or not they are a scam, and if you are considering getting involved in one such scheme, then knowing the answer to this question is going to prove to be rather important for your overall decision.</p>
<p>The problem here is that it all depends on the sources that you read, as well as their reasons behind taking a particular point of view, so that is something that you have to keep at the forefront of your mind. So, that aside, let’s look at the potential positives and negatives that could help you to come to some kind of decision all on your own.</p>
<p><span id="more-20"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-21 aligncenter" src="../wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pump_dump_scam.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pump_dump_scam.jpg 1200w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pump_dump_scam-300x158.jpg 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pump_dump_scam-768x403.jpg 768w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pump_dump_scam-1024x538.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p><strong>The Basics of a Pump and Dump Group.</strong></p>
<p>The basics of a pump and dump group are easy to follow. A group of people agree to purchase a number of coins of a particular altcoin at the same time to push the price up. Other buyers outwith the group see the movement so seek to purchase coins as well, and the group also tries to bring more people in as well, so the price continues to climb. At an agreed moment, the people in the pump and dump group will then sell their coins as they have made a profit, and more often than not the price will tumble back down.</p>
<p>It really is that simple. You buy low, and you end up selling when the cryptocurrency is high resulting in some pretty mind-blowing profits from time to time. As a result, it will not be unusual for people to make over 100% profit, even though some groups claim you will make a 2000% profit but that is hardly true.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, is this kind of thing really a scam, or is it simply a clever ploy that traders across the board would use no matter the item or product that they were dealing with? Is it something to be avoided, or should you be willing to dive right in there and get involved at the absolute heart of a pump and dump group?</p>
<p><strong>The Dangers of a Pump and Dump Group.</strong></p>
<p>To get closer to the answer as to whether or not this is a scam, we need to examine the dangers that are often associated with this entire approach because even though it sounds as if it would be impossible to achieve anything other than a huge profit, that’s not the case.</p>
<p>Instead, there is always the possibility that the plan goes wrong, but it must be stressed that it is not due to the group that it would go wrong but rather the actions of the individual.</p>
<p>The main danger, and this is where people then start to argue that a pump and dump group is a scam, is that people effectively time things wrong and are not paying attention to the different signals and messages that are sent out to everyone in the group.</p>
<p>The danger is that things have to work like clockwork because of the way in which the altcoin is bought and then sold in such a short period of time. Failing to react quickly enough is going to result in you cutting your profits, or missing out entirely which is also not exactly the best thing to happen.</p>
<p>Also, people will sometimes panic if they have missed the countdown and will try to purchase as many tokens as they can but at that point it is all too easy to end up getting a loss, or stuck with coins until they climb in price once again, simply because of trying to get in on the act at the wrong time.</p>
<p>Either situation is hardly going to be ideal, but at the same time it cannot be argued that this makes the entire thing a scam.</p>
<p>There is also the argument that this pump and dump concept is illegal in the stock market, even though it does still go on via hidden methods, but here is one very important point that cannot be forgotten. The world of cryptocurrency is heavily unregulated, and this means that this particular strategy is not illegal in any way, so there has to be the conclusion that it cannot be a scam when nothing illegal is happening as that would just not make any sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>So, the only potential issue is connected to the way in which the individual pays attention to the information that is being passed to them for the sake of the pump and dump. While it does inflate the price, and then decreases after the dump, it has been shown over and over again that the price does then recover thanks to the increased awareness of the cryptocurrency when before it was perhaps struggling.</p>
<p>In other words, those outside of the group that purchase coins just before the pump aspect ends may feel that they have been duped as the price crashes, but all it takes on their part is some patience and things will still pan out in their favor over the longer term. It will only be those people that want to make some fast profits that see it as being a problem, in which case they should have been a member of the group if that is what they were seeking.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be your decision as to whether or not you believe in this approach or approve of it. However, there can be little doubt that there are a number of people that have been able to make a significant profit from pump and dump groups, and you will not be any different. As we have said over and over again, whether it works or not for you will be dependent on you paying close attention, and if you are able to do that then there is no way that you will determine that this is a scam.</p>
