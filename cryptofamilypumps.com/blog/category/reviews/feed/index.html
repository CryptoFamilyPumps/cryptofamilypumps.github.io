				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At first, you may be forgiven for thinking that it is very easy to spot a crypto pump and dump scheme as the signs should be there in clear view. After all, part of the approach of the scheme is to encourage more people to purchase the altcoin that they are targeting since this pushes up the price of the coin and they make more profit.</p>
<p><span id="more-50"></span></p>
<p>However, even though this is true, you clearly want to get in on the act as early as possible. Alternatively, you might also want to be able to spot one to avoid being caught up in the rush and panic to purchase the coin in question only to then discover that you have had your fingers burnt by simply not paying attention.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-51 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="534" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc.jpg 720w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><strong>What is a Pump and Dump Scheme?</strong></p>
<p>Before going into how you identify this scheme, a brief explanation as to what we mean by a pump and dump scheme is going to be in order. After all, how are you going to be able to identify it if you have no idea what it is that we are talking about?</p>
<p>The easiest way to explain all of this is that it is a type of trading whereby the market is manipulated for the benefit of those individuals, or companies, that are involved in the scheme. This is not something that is unique to cryptocurrency trading as it has been around for decades with a main focus on the equities market, but it has certainly taken hold in this particular market.</p>
<p>The quick explanation is that a pump and dump scheme in connection with cryptocurrency trading involves a group of people working together to artificially boost the value of a particular altcoin. They purchase a significant number of coins at the same time with this causing the value to increase quite considerably with this being known as the pump.</p>
<p>Once they have achieved their target price, which is agreed in advance, everyone in the scheme sells the coins, which means they are effectively dumping them back on the market. This will then drive the price in a downward spiral with the people in the group making a substantial profit.</p>
<p><strong>How to Identify a Pump and Dump Scheme.</strong></p>
<p>In order to identify a pump and dump scheme, the key is to be able to understand the trading charts for the various altcoins that are on a number of different exchanges. This is where you will be able to spend time studying the rise and fall of the various altcoins because that is how you can begin to spot some rather not so subtle changes in the values.</p>
<p>Often, you will be able to identify an altcoin that was previously unknown suddenly increase in value quite substantially and for no apparent reason. Indeed, there are some coin price charts that set in rates whereby there are triggers when a coin suddenly increases in price by more than 5% in 5 minutes. When this happens, the coin in question can then appear on a list as potentially being involved in a pump and dump scheme.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only way in which you are able to identify a potential pump and dump scheme.</p>
<p>The other common method is to pay close attention to certain news stories, and not the normal kind that come from real writers or journalists. Instead, we are talking about paid for stories that have a very specific reasoning behind their very existence.</p>
<p>Often, the coins that they focus on have a relatively small cap but the appearance of the story is then able to coincide with a significant upsurge in activity on social media networks and platforms. This can result in a small coin making a huge impact on the likes of Twitter and Facebook with profiles and groups all talking about this coin that has, up until this moment, managed to achieve very little at all.</p>
<p>Finally, if you realize that a particular altcoin that was small has actually managed to capitalize on the market, and it has absolutely no right to achieve this, then there is a pretty good chance that it has been pushed by artificial and fake methods.</p>
<p><strong>Offering Some Protection from these Schemes.</strong></p>
<p>So, we have shown how you can identify these schemes, but then how do you go ahead and protect yourself from them? Well, this is actually easier than you think, and it is all connected to the way in which you go about your business of trading in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>A main point is that there is a significant focus on coins that generally have a much lower trading volume. That is because they can be easily manipulated and the price can increase without much work. Also, when you study those charts and see that the price is soaring, then it is up to you as to whether or not you then want to go ahead and get involved in purchasing that coin knowing full well that the price will crash at any moment.</p>
<p>However, perhaps the best piece of advice when trying to identify a pump and dump scheme is to make sure that you do your research before you take action, and this applies no matter the side of the fence that you are on. Of course, it is entirely up to you to determine if you wish to participate in the pump and dump scheme.</p>
<p>As you can see, being able to identify these schemes is a lot easier than you may have previously been aware. As long as you can spend some time studying the markets and paying close attention to the movement of various coins, then you should get to a point where you can identify these pump and dump schemes even if you are not a member of the group yourself. Of course, as you see the profits that they can make then it may propel you into joining in because at least then you will be on the inside rather than simply standing back and watching what is going on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The problem with bots is that they will often promise the world only for some of them to fall short with what they have initially stated that they are able to do. Immediately, you can understand why this is such an issue especially when you are using the bot in an attempt to make money in some way. Ultimately, it will be up to you and you alone to determine the best bot for your needs, and to do so before you become too involved.</p>
<p><span id="more-47"></span></p>
<p>Take the best Bitcoin trading bots as a prime example. When you are dealing with something such as Bitcoin and trading in this cryptocurrency that seems to run rampant, the last thing you want is for a trading bot to be lacklustre in its approach. With this, it can be all too easy for you to lose out on a lot of cash, and what point is the bot if it does the opposite of what you want it for?</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-48 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc-robot.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="298" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc-robot.jpg 580w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc-robot-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 85vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>So, let’s go back to the idea of checking out the best Bitcoin trading bots.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use a Bot?</strong></p>
<p>The first point that we need to address is why you would even want to use a trading bot in the first place, and understanding all of this makes it easier to know which Bitcoin trading bots are actually the best out there.</p>
<p>Usually, a bot is used because it just makes the entire trading part of the process run faster, more smoothly, and you can even program it to carry out cryptocurrency trades as you sleep. In other words, it removes so many of the issues and difficulties often associated with trading, so that alone is not exactly a bad thing.</p>
<p>If we are honest, do you have the time and willingness to go ahead and watch the trading charts all of the time to then know when to buy and sell? Absolutely not as that would be completely mind-numbing, so if this can then all be replicated by a trading bot, then it will automatically become a rather intriguing concept.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Bot?</strong></p>
<p>So, the points we mentioned above are pretty easy to understand and you can see why people are drawn towards potentially using a bot for their trading. However, what exactly is it?</p>
<p>In this instance, what we are talking about is a program that runs automatically and can do a multitude of tasks. With this, it will study the markets, look at the volumes being bought and sold, the price, and what is happening over time. However, the cool part in all of this is that there’s absolutely no need for you to worry about trying to program the bot or write software because there are various options out there on the market that are going to do all of this for you.</p>
<p>As you can see, a trading bot is designed to not do very much, but what it does is capable of completely changing the way that you trade with your Bitcoins.</p>
<p><strong>The Best Bitcoin Trading Bots.</strong></p>
<p>So, if we keep all of the points mentioned above in mind, then what do we feel are going to be the best Bitcoin trading bots that are out there on the market at this moment in time? These are not in any order of preference as we believe that they are all pretty good.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gekko.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Gekko is one of the more popular Bitcoin trading bots in circulation, and that might have something to do with it being able to work on 18 different Bitcoin exchanges. Also, it is completely free to download which is always another bonus and with some basic strategies built into its programming, then it covers pretty much everything that you want from a bot.</p>
<p>However, it does come with a few issues in that you cannot perform arbitrage tasks with this bot which could be a problem for some people. Also, you are also unable to carry out a high frequency of trades, which could also be a reason to steer clear of it if you are serious about cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>BTC Robot.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>BTC Robot has proven itself over and over again to be a more than useful trading tool for Bitcoins. Not only is it fully automated, but they also offer various membership levels to help you get started. It can be slightly complex to get it up and running, but there are a number of people that are ultimately making some pretty modest profits by using this bot, so there is real possibilities with the software.</p>
<p>Also, people state that it is pretty easy to set it all up, which is what you want from any software, and it can then effectively run on its own and without any interference from you. Furthermore, you might want to know that there is a 60 day money back guarantee, which means there is really nothing to lose.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Zenbot.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps the main advantage of potentially using Zenbot is that it can deal with high-frequency trades, which a lot of bots simply come up short with. Also, it can cope with multiple assets at the one time, and this is another bonus. There is also a good track record with this bot for people making profits with everything being completely automated, and it also supports a number of the key Bitcoin exchanges. The only problem is a lack of updates, but it still performs well.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Cryptotrader.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have never heard of Cryptotrader, then you are not alone. However, it does offer a number of options and it is cloud based, so there’s no need to install software. It focuses on algorithms for the trades and states that it is capable of studying the markets in minutes to then help with the trading aspect. They work with all of the main exchanges and state that their bot is cutting-edge but as long as it can generate a profit, then that’s all you need to worry about.</p>
<p>Those are not all of the Bitcoin bots that are out there on the market, but they are certainly the ones that we believe are the best and most fit for their purpose. Of course, you can make up your own mind but just make sure that the bot can make money for you or else what was the point of it all?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The aim of this Binance review is to determine if it is a cryptocurrency exchange that you should use, or is it something that you should steer clear of. Considering there are different exchanges out there in the market that all offer the same kind of thing, understanding what Binance brings to the table does make a lot of sense. After all, if you are serious about getting involved in cryptocurrency trading in general, then having a good exchange that you can rely on will have a direct impact on your future ability to trade effectively.</p>
<p><span id="more-34"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-35 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_review.png" alt="" width="1268" height="724" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_review.png 1268w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_review-300x171.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_review-768x439.png 768w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_review-1024x585.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p><strong>The Origins of Binance.</strong></p>
<p>First, let’s check out the origins of the exchange, and what we see is that it was established in Hong Kong in July, 2017 and it was created after a successful ICO that eventually raised $15 million. The company behind it is called Beijie Technology, and its founder is Changpeng Zhao with the company and founder having a stellar reputation within the industry after previously having held a number of high-profile positions.</p>
<p>In other words, the founder has not just come from nowhere to open this exchange as he does have a significant amount of previous experience, which is always going to be important in starting to build trust in the platform and that they do know what they are doing.</p>
<p><strong>The Start of the Exchange.</strong></p>
<p>Even though it is relatively common for a new exchange or cryptocurrency to have some initial success, in the case of Binance there’s no doubt that it has exceeded expectations. Within a short period of time, it was comfortably holding a top ten place in the list of cryptocurrency exchanges with the greatest amount of trade over a 24 hour period, which is in itself a major achievement.</p>
<p>From a confidence perspective, this does show that a number of traders have a significant amount of confidence in the quality of the service on offer from them leading to this real surge in activity on the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>The Positives of the Binance Exchange.</strong></p>
<p>Prior to conducting trades on the exchange, it does make sense to be aware of the positives that come with using Binance. You clearly want to be aware of this so that you know your trades are in safe hands and that you are getting the correct rates since this alone will cut into your profits.</p>
<p>Well, first there are a vast array of cryptocurrencies for you to trade in which always opens up a plethora of possibilities. Within this, you are going to find all of the main altcoins as well as trade pairings, and with them currently having over 100 coins in their listings, then it gives you an idea of the scale of this cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they have also sought to deal with the issue surrounding fees as they are often regarded as being too high for traders or they fluctuate too much making it harder to complete the trade. Instead, with Binance they have kept it to a straightforward 0.1%, and there are also opportunities to have that reduced further which is cool in its own right.</p>
<p>You will end up having to pay withdrawal fees, but that is completely normal even though they do charge less than a number of other companies. It always depends on the cryptocurrency that you are withdrawing, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Another area where Binance is not exactly lacking is in customer support. The only problem is that you might wait some time to get a reply simply because of the sheer volume of traffic and trading that they handle on a daily basis, so once again that is not something that is unusual. There is a QR code and a WeChat option that may work for you, but that is not guaranteed and some of the answers that you get will be automated.</p>
<p>However, at least there are several ways to get in touch with them, and as long as you have some patience then it should work out quite well.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-36 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_exchange.png" alt="" width="952" height="721" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_exchange.png 952w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_exchange-300x227.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_exchange-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Finally, they have a clean interface for you to work from which is always a good thing as it allows you to keep track of the various rates so you don’t miss out on a good deal.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Issues with Binance?</strong></p>
<p>To be fair, Binance is not 100% perfect as there are some areas where they could be performing slightly better. The customer service could be improved, and this is especially true for the WeChat option, as it simply does not work right and if they are going to offer it, then this should not be the case.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there is nothing really to worry about with Binance as they do at least cover the various bases, and do a thorough job in doing so, which is not too bad when you consider the other cryptocurrency exchanges that are out there that have had various allegations levelled at them over time.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a Scam?</strong></p>
<p>We also need to address a rather important point as there have been some claims that this exchange is a scam. This is all linked to the way in which some individuals have difficulty in withdrawing funds from time to time but this is due to a temperamental 2FA/SMS confirmation rather than anything else. From that perspective, this is not a scam in any way as it is a technical issue instead of them simply wanting to take your money.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Conclusion About Binance.</strong></p>
<p>To conclude, Binance is actually one of the best cryptocurrency exchanges that are out there simply because of the low fees mixed in with the multitude of cryptocurrencies that are on offer. This provides you more than enough scope for trading as well as making it easier to increase the level of trading that is possible via this exchange.</p>
<p>This is something that operates as smoothly as possible considering what it deals with and creating your account on their platform takes minutes to do. Aside from the SMS issue, depositing and withdrawing funds is also not going to be a problem, and it is not just us saying that as there are countless other reviews and comments on message boards that back up our view that Binance is something that is effective and can be trusted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The aim of this Big Pump Signal review is to provide you with some insight into the way that they operate to help you in deciding as to whether or not this is something you should be getting involved in. Considering the potential profits that are at stake, it makes so much sense to do your research first, so let’s get into it.</p>
<p>Big Pump Signal is a pump and dump group dedicated to helping its followers to pump and dump different altcoins that are on the market. In this respect, they are no different to other similar groups that are out there as they all have the exact same aim, which is to boost the profits of those individuals that are in the group.</p>
<p><span id="more-28"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-29 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bigpumpsignal.png" alt="" width="1497" height="851" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bigpumpsignal.png 1497w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bigpumpsignal-300x171.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bigpumpsignal-768x437.png 768w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bigpumpsignal-1024x582.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p><strong>The Size of the Group.</strong></p>
<p>Big Pump Signal state that they are the biggest group of its kind in the world, which is a pretty big statement to make all things taken into consideration. By all accounts, they have somewhere in the region of 50,000 followers, and that does mean that if everyone comes together for the same pump and dump that they can have a major impact on the market for any cryptocurrency that they plan to focus on.</p>
<p><strong>What are Their Main Aims?</strong></p>
<p>The main aim of the group is to change the price of the cryptocurrency that they are focusing on, and it runs along the same lines as every other pump and dump group that is out there. They keep their members in the loop with what is going on via their social media accounts, including their Telegram channel, so people know what to purchase, and when they should be looking at making that investment.</p>
<p>So, in that respect, they are not doing anything special or different to everything else that runs along similar lines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they choose the coins that they will focus on in the same manner as well with the main idea being that a coin is chosen simply because it has real potential and there is a very real possibility of the price being manipulated in the process. However, this in itself is not ground-breaking, and is still no different from other options that are on the market.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Features on the Platform.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, Big Pump Signal does provide a number of other features on their platform that will help to make the entire process that bit easier, as well as providing a way to further increase the profit that you can make. Features include protection from bots, an affiliate system, and a crypto chat where people can be kept up to date on everything that is going on, as well as vote on the next moves.</p>
<p>Even though this does impressive, it needs to be stressed that this is still no different from every other pump and dump group out there and it is merely the size of the group that is making a huge difference.</p>
<p>That being said, a number of the features that they have are certainly required for everything to kind of work without any interference. Take the bot protection as a prime example, there is such a risk associated with bots basically ruining the pump aspect that there has to be some kind of protection from it. The key area has to be when the coin is announced as bots can pick up on that kind of announcement and then steal the show and ruin the entire pump.</p>
<p>That is why they use a CAPTCHA format when it comes to this announcement. By doing this, it cannot be read by a bot, and it is such a simple solution for something that is potentially a huge, and very costly, problem.</p>
<p><strong>Is It Worth Joining?</strong></p>
<p>So, here’s the important part, is it worth joining this particular pump and dump group? Well, forget for a moment that the key parts in what they offer are the same as you will get anywhere else as that is less important than you may think at this moment in time.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to look at it from a different perspective. Yes, there are a lot of people in the group, and that kind of co-ordinated attack will make a huge difference to the movement of the currency, but how many people actually take part at any given time? There is also the issue of voting for the next move because with a group of this size it takes some organizing, but it is certainly something that they have got running smoothly.</p>
<p>Of course, you have no pressure placed upon you for the amount of money that you spend on the pump, so having no minimal investment figure to take part is certainly a positive. The reason for that is they simply look at the group size rather than anything else, and as they have a lot of people involved then the individual amounts matter less than you would perhaps imagine.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s free to join, so there is basically no risk at all as you can sign up, check out what is going on, and then make your decision as to whether or not you are going to take part. No pressure and no threat of being kicked out if you decide you do not want to take part in the next movement.</p>
<p>So, to bring this review to an end, we have to say that their group runs smoothly, and there is no doubt that if you follow the rules then there is real potential to go ahead and make a profit. Yes, there are issues and concerns but that is more to do with the nature of the cryptocurrency market rather than anything else.</p>
<p>Joining a pump and dump group makes so much sense, and if you are serious about cryptocurrency trading, then this is certainly one road that you might want to go along. Just be sure that you only purchase with money that you know you can afford to lose to avoid running into any additional problems.</p>
