		<p>If we are honest, the number of different cryptocurrencies that are out on the market at this point has reached crazy numbers. This alone makes life so much harder when you are looking at trying to decide on the things that you should invest in, which is why it will be even more important than ever before to do your research before gambling with your money.</p>
<p><span id="more-76"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-77 aligncenter" src="../wp-content/uploads/2018/04/eth.png" alt="" width="931" height="412" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/eth.png 931w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/eth-300x133.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/eth-768x340.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>As part of that research, we are going to look at several of the cryptocurrencies that we believe will be the best investment opportunities at this moment in time. However, do remember that markets change and fluctuate, so check out the current status before you dive in.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Ethereum.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After Bitcoin, this is the next most popular cryptocurrency around and for some people it is actually turning into their favorite cryptocurrency due to the technology that lies behind it all. Of course, it is helped by the way in which so many altcoins are built on the Ethereum blockchain and platform thanks to the way in which the technology allows for the creation of Smart Contracts.</p>
<p>Because of this, there will always be a need for Ethereum to exist, and as more altcoins appear on the market that are using it as a core platform, then it stands to reason that investing in this coin would certainly be a good decision.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Ripple.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Ripple has been on a charge as of late to the point where it is now one of the biggest cryptocurrencies around according to the size of the market. This has also seen a huge rise in its value over the last 12 months with it increasing by approximately 37,900% which is absolutely amazing. This is something that is only going to continue to increase in value in the foreseeable future and the cool thing is that the value of each token is still relatively low compared to others that are out there.</p>
<p>However, with a total market value in excess of $118 billion, investing in Ripple could prove to be a rather important decision.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Stellar.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Stellar might not be as popular or as well-known as some of the other options on this list, but it still represents a wonderful opportunity for anybody that is seeking to invest in a cryptocurrency throughout 2018. They state that it is their aim to make it easier for people to make payments using digital currencies and they hope to really work alongside banks.</p>
<p>They actually run on the same premise as Ripple, and the way in which Ripple has gained in popularity in the last year has also had a profound impact on the price of the Stellar digital currency as well. An interesting point to make is that the price per token is substantially lower than you may have expected from a cryptocurrency that is riding high, but then it did start off exceptionally low giving it room to move without pricing itself out of the market. If you are new to investing in cryptocurrencies, then this could very well become one of the best ones to start off with.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> IOTA.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One thing that you have to say about IOTA is that it does have the ability to effectively look into the future with what it is able to offer. By focusing on the Internet of Things, which is an area that is just becoming even more popular than ever before, it means that they have been able to find their niche and have capitalized on it accordingly. The token itself has seen a price increase in the region of 1000% in recent times, which is pretty impressive all on its own, and it is a price that is only going to continue to increase in value in the near future.</p>
<p>The fact that people are able to transfer payments on their system with zero fees is seriously impressive, and that is just one of many features that both the token and platform in general is able to offer you. With a focus on both micro and nano transactions, IOTA is able to carve out its market and is well on its way to dominating it accordingly.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Litecoin.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Created by an ex-Google engineer back in 2011, this was viewed as being a better alternative to what Bitcoin was offering, and even though it has not reached the heights of Bitcoin, there’s no doubt that Litecoin has still been able to grab a substantial share of the market.</p>
<p>This coin seeks to undo the problems that surround Bitcoin by offering higher coin limits, faster transaction times and lower fees. It is a cryptocurrency in the truest sense of the word as it does not seek to run a blockchain platform like Ethereum. However, with the price continuing to increase, Litecoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that you should seriously consider investing in over the next 12 months.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> NEO.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This cryptocurrency is based in China and it seeks to offer what they call a ‘smart economy’ which sounds way more complicated than it actually is. Also, it is looking at dealing with digital assets as well as digitizing physical ones that can then be traded via digital means and without there being any need for a third-party to be involved.</p>
<p>The best thing about Neo is that the cryptocurrency has not really suffered from the volatile nature of so many cryptocurrencies and its price has been relatively steady as a result. With a market value in excess of $6 billion, it is growing fast and shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there for you to choose from when you are looking at investing, but we believe that the six mentioned above are well worth checking out as they are not only relatively stable but also tend to represent value for money as well. Of course, there’s no way that you can guarantee that the price will not drop at some point, but as long as you are looking for the long-term investment then these options could be the best way to go.</p>
