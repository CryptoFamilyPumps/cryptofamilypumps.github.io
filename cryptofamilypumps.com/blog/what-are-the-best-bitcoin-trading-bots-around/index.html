		<p>The problem with bots is that they will often promise the world only for some of them to fall short with what they have initially stated that they are able to do. Immediately, you can understand why this is such an issue especially when you are using the bot in an attempt to make money in some way. Ultimately, it will be up to you and you alone to determine the best bot for your needs, and to do so before you become too involved.</p>
<p><span id="more-47"></span></p>
<p>Take the best Bitcoin trading bots as a prime example. When you are dealing with something such as Bitcoin and trading in this cryptocurrency that seems to run rampant, the last thing you want is for a trading bot to be lacklustre in its approach. With this, it can be all too easy for you to lose out on a lot of cash, and what point is the bot if it does the opposite of what you want it for?</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-48 aligncenter" src="../wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc-robot.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="298" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc-robot.jpg 580w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc-robot-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 85vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>So, let’s go back to the idea of checking out the best Bitcoin trading bots.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use a Bot?</strong></p>
<p>The first point that we need to address is why you would even want to use a trading bot in the first place, and understanding all of this makes it easier to know which Bitcoin trading bots are actually the best out there.</p>
<p>Usually, a bot is used because it just makes the entire trading part of the process run faster, more smoothly, and you can even program it to carry out cryptocurrency trades as you sleep. In other words, it removes so many of the issues and difficulties often associated with trading, so that alone is not exactly a bad thing.</p>
<p>If we are honest, do you have the time and willingness to go ahead and watch the trading charts all of the time to then know when to buy and sell? Absolutely not as that would be completely mind-numbing, so if this can then all be replicated by a trading bot, then it will automatically become a rather intriguing concept.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Bot?</strong></p>
<p>So, the points we mentioned above are pretty easy to understand and you can see why people are drawn towards potentially using a bot for their trading. However, what exactly is it?</p>
<p>In this instance, what we are talking about is a program that runs automatically and can do a multitude of tasks. With this, it will study the markets, look at the volumes being bought and sold, the price, and what is happening over time. However, the cool part in all of this is that there’s absolutely no need for you to worry about trying to program the bot or write software because there are various options out there on the market that are going to do all of this for you.</p>
<p>As you can see, a trading bot is designed to not do very much, but what it does is capable of completely changing the way that you trade with your Bitcoins.</p>
<p><strong>The Best Bitcoin Trading Bots.</strong></p>
<p>So, if we keep all of the points mentioned above in mind, then what do we feel are going to be the best Bitcoin trading bots that are out there on the market at this moment in time? These are not in any order of preference as we believe that they are all pretty good.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gekko.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Gekko is one of the more popular Bitcoin trading bots in circulation, and that might have something to do with it being able to work on 18 different Bitcoin exchanges. Also, it is completely free to download which is always another bonus and with some basic strategies built into its programming, then it covers pretty much everything that you want from a bot.</p>
<p>However, it does come with a few issues in that you cannot perform arbitrage tasks with this bot which could be a problem for some people. Also, you are also unable to carry out a high frequency of trades, which could also be a reason to steer clear of it if you are serious about cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>BTC Robot.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>BTC Robot has proven itself over and over again to be a more than useful trading tool for Bitcoins. Not only is it fully automated, but they also offer various membership levels to help you get started. It can be slightly complex to get it up and running, but there are a number of people that are ultimately making some pretty modest profits by using this bot, so there is real possibilities with the software.</p>
<p>Also, people state that it is pretty easy to set it all up, which is what you want from any software, and it can then effectively run on its own and without any interference from you. Furthermore, you might want to know that there is a 60 day money back guarantee, which means there is really nothing to lose.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Zenbot.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps the main advantage of potentially using Zenbot is that it can deal with high-frequency trades, which a lot of bots simply come up short with. Also, it can cope with multiple assets at the one time, and this is another bonus. There is also a good track record with this bot for people making profits with everything being completely automated, and it also supports a number of the key Bitcoin exchanges. The only problem is a lack of updates, but it still performs well.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Cryptotrader.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have never heard of Cryptotrader, then you are not alone. However, it does offer a number of options and it is cloud based, so there’s no need to install software. It focuses on algorithms for the trades and states that it is capable of studying the markets in minutes to then help with the trading aspect. They work with all of the main exchanges and state that their bot is cutting-edge but as long as it can generate a profit, then that’s all you need to worry about.</p>
<p>Those are not all of the Bitcoin bots that are out there on the market, but they are certainly the ones that we believe are the best and most fit for their purpose. Of course, you can make up your own mind but just make sure that the bot can make money for you or else what was the point of it all?</p>
