		<p>So, pump and dump groups, what exactly are they? This is a question that people are asking themselves for two reasons, one to avoid them and the other to join in with the fun that is being had by the group in question. This is something that has become more popular in recent times, and perhaps the coolest part of all is that it is very easy to understand, and if you want to become involved in the practice, then that is also not going to prove to be too difficult either.</p>
<p><span id="more-8"></span></p>
<p>Pump and dump groups are focused all on cryptocurrencies, and there are clearly a huge number of digital currencies to choose from. The basic, and quick, explanation for what they do is to work together to purchase a set currency at an agreed time to force the price to rise. Within that same short period of time, they then sell the currency and make a quick profit in the meantime.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-9 aligncenter" src="../wp-content/uploads/2018/04/crypto-pump-dump.png" alt="" width="508" height="310" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/crypto-pump-dump.png 508w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/crypto-pump-dump-300x183.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 85vw, 508px" /></p>
<p>As you can imagine, this is something that is very attractive to a number of people because of the simplicity of the plan. It can become very easy to make a profit on your initial investment, but it is all done in a controlled manner and there is some skill behind the entire approach. However, it can be significantly easier than you may have initially thought, which is seriously cool.</p>
<p>So, how does it all work? How is it possible to make a profit from something called ‘pump and dump’?</p>
<p>Well, first you need to get a group of people together that are willing to invest in a co-ordinated manner with a specific cryptocurrency. There are times where over 50,000 people are involved at the same moment, so if they all invest even a small amount of money, then you can begin to understand how it can have a major influence on the entire market. This is key so that the profits can be made, but there is a sense of being organized as well to get this entire thing to work.</p>
<p>As the group is being brought together, everything is dealt with via the likes of a Telegram channel where people are advised of the plan and the exact instructions that they need to follow. It can be essential that they do take heed of the instructions or it could turn out quite badly for everyone hence the need for it all to be co-ordinated so that mistakes can be avoided.</p>
<p>Once the group has been created, there is a community vote on the altcoin that is going to be the focus of their attention. Once it is selected, there is a time arranged for the initial purchase since it is going to be at a lower price at this moment in time, and that is when the entire plan is set and ready to go. You can see why you need to be fully aware of what is happening at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Action with Pump and Dump.</strong></p>
<p>At the agreed time, everyone in the pump and dump group will then purchase the altcoin that has been chosen. This is going to automatically make the price of the coin soar because of the sudden huge interest in it which is why people need to buy it literally within a few seconds to then get the maximum profit. As the price rockets, people outwith the group see that the price is climbing fast so they want to then purchase the altcoins to make a profit, but that is where the clever part comes into play.</p>
<p>After next to no time at all, everyone in the group then looks to sell the altcoins since it is now at an inflated price. At times, the price can increase by over 100% giving everyone an amazing profit on the coin which they then dump immediately. In other words, it is a short-term game with high-gain profits.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Any Problems?</strong></p>
<p>People look at pump and dump groups and wonder if there are any problems, and there is one issue that can still be rectified just by being rather intelligent in your approach.</p>
<p>The problem is if you are not paying attention and sell the altcoin at the right time because once it is being sold, then the price is going to drop quite fast. However, it has been shown over and over again that the interest that is generated in the altcoin outwith the group does mean that the price will start to climb again even after the dump is completed. In this instance, it simply takes some patience and paying close attention to the market for you to still make that all important profit.</p>
<p>In other words, it is more of an annoyance rather than a problem, but it can certainly be overcome with ease, which has to be amazing news for anybody with an interest in making money in this way.</p>
<p>A pump and dump group is for anybody that has an interest in both cryptocurrency and making a profit from trading. In fact, there’s not even any need to have a firm understanding of the mechanisms just as long as you know how to purchase coins and then sell them again. It really is that simple, and perhaps your hardest task is going to be getting in on the group in the first place, but even that is not complicated.</p>
<p>So, if you are looking at trying to make a profit from crypocurrencies and are put off by the idea of playing the long waiting game to get your money back, then at least there is another option out there for you to take advantage of. Tens of thousands of people use this method on a daily basis and are making insane profits from it all of the time, and you can join them. Sign up, pay attention to what is going on, and follow the simple instructions and there should be no problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>Now, does that not sound like the perfect investment opportunity for you?</p>
