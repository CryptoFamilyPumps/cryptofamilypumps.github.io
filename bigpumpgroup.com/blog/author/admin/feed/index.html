				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It sometimes feels as if there is a new cryptocurrency exchange coming out on a weekly basis, and at times that is perhaps closer to the truth than you realize. However, what that all then means is there being a need for us to spend some time trying to determine the different cryptocurrency exchanges that will be the best ones to use for your trades. After all, who wants to be caught out by using a poor exchange that offers slow service and poor pricing, not to mention limited trading pairs?</p>
<p><span id="more-79"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-80 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bittrex.png" alt="" width="1267" height="720" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bittrex.png 1267w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bittrex-300x170.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bittrex-768x436.png 768w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bittrex-1024x582.png 1024w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bittrex-1200x682.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Thankfully, as there are just so many options it does mean that we can be rather picky as to the ones that we select, so we do believe that the names that follow should be absolutely fine for you to check out.</p>
<p><strong>Coinbase.</strong></p>
<p>Coinbase has to be one of the most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges around, and it is primarily to do with the way in which it has USD at the absolute core of the different trades that it offers. Based in San Francisco, it is said that they have over 13 million users, but there’s a problem. The problem is that they are also known for having some of the highest fees in the market, which could be enough to put you off using them as there are cheaper options elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Coinmama.</strong></p>
<p>Created in 2013, the main way in which Coinmama was able to gain a foothold in the market was by becoming one of the first exchanges to allow both credit and debit cards to be used in order to purchase cryptocurrencies. This has undoubtedly made it significantly easier to purchase tokens and you are also able to go ahead and automatically transfer the coins to another wallet as soon as they are purchased. They also charge quite high fees but the fact that the interface and exchange is so easy to use does work in its favor.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini.</strong></p>
<p>Launched in 2015, this exchange is well-known for its customer service which is viewed as going above and beyond the normal call of duty. They have focused primarily on offering a service to those just starting out, and as a result they have restricted the number of cryptocurrencies that they have available. However, even though there are these limitations, they make it one of the easiest exchanges to use, and for that it should be applauded.</p>
<p><strong>BitQuick.</strong></p>
<p>BitQuick is rather cool in its approach as it certainly tries to do things a bit differently to the other options out there on the market. They actually allow you to deposit cash into a bank account that can then be used for your orders, so they are combining both the online and offline worlds in a unique way. The only problem with this is that some people do view it as being a potential security risk and this puts them off trying it out. However, the exchange does have a stellar reputation, so perhaps being so concerned is rather pointless.</p>
<p><strong>Binance.</strong></p>
<p>Binance deals in crypto to crypto exchanges and it is argued that this is the top cryptocurrency exchange in the entire world. Also, it has been able to do this in next to no time at all and it is all thanks to it having an array of features that not only makes it rather easy to use, but it just offers so much to each individual user.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are an extensive number of trading pairs through this exchange as well as low fees and fast transaction times, so when you put it all together it is then not that surprising that its popularity has blown everybody else out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>Bittrex.</strong></p>
<p>Bittrex is based in Seattle, and they are rather strict when it comes to following the various regulations as set out by the authorities in the United States. Up until recently, they were also one of the biggest exchanges in the world until Binance soared past them, but they are certainly still worth checking out what they have to offer as their interface is easy to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Cryptopia.</strong></p>
<p>The best thing about the Cryptopia cryptocurrency exchange is that it has a tendency to focus on those coins that are perhaps not as well known as others or altcoins that are just starting out. This does mean that they have created their own niche market, which is pretty cool and they have been able to build their reputation on the back of all of this. Their fees are low and their customer support is seen as being excellent, but do be aware that they do not accept Ethereum so that may put off some people from trying them out.</p>
<p><strong>KuCoin.</strong></p>
<p>KuCoin gets a mention in this list simply because of what it is that they offer their users. This company is based in Hong Kong and what they seek to do is to distribute the profits that they make to their users via their very own coin that they themselves created. This is an interesting development, and it is certainly something that you can see working in their favor even though the trading volume that passes through their exchange on a daily basis is not up to the levels of other options.</p>
<p>Of course, these are only a few of the options that are out there when it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges, but we believe that the names we have listed above are going to play a pivotal role in the industry throughout 2018. Each one has its benefits and advantages over the others, and it is up to you to ultimately find out which one best fits your own individual needs or requirements and then stick to it when you are happy with what they have to offer.</p>
<p>That being said, there are new exchanges appearing all of the time, and even though it will prove to be difficult for any new one to reach the heights of those listed above, it will always be possible so keep an eye out for any newcomers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If we are honest, the number of different cryptocurrencies that are out on the market at this point has reached crazy numbers. This alone makes life so much harder when you are looking at trying to decide on the things that you should invest in, which is why it will be even more important than ever before to do your research before gambling with your money.</p>
<p><span id="more-76"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-77 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/eth.png" alt="" width="931" height="412" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/eth.png 931w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/eth-300x133.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/eth-768x340.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>As part of that research, we are going to look at several of the cryptocurrencies that we believe will be the best investment opportunities at this moment in time. However, do remember that markets change and fluctuate, so check out the current status before you dive in.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Ethereum.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After Bitcoin, this is the next most popular cryptocurrency around and for some people it is actually turning into their favorite cryptocurrency due to the technology that lies behind it all. Of course, it is helped by the way in which so many altcoins are built on the Ethereum blockchain and platform thanks to the way in which the technology allows for the creation of Smart Contracts.</p>
<p>Because of this, there will always be a need for Ethereum to exist, and as more altcoins appear on the market that are using it as a core platform, then it stands to reason that investing in this coin would certainly be a good decision.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Ripple.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Ripple has been on a charge as of late to the point where it is now one of the biggest cryptocurrencies around according to the size of the market. This has also seen a huge rise in its value over the last 12 months with it increasing by approximately 37,900% which is absolutely amazing. This is something that is only going to continue to increase in value in the foreseeable future and the cool thing is that the value of each token is still relatively low compared to others that are out there.</p>
<p>However, with a total market value in excess of $118 billion, investing in Ripple could prove to be a rather important decision.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Stellar.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Stellar might not be as popular or as well-known as some of the other options on this list, but it still represents a wonderful opportunity for anybody that is seeking to invest in a cryptocurrency throughout 2018. They state that it is their aim to make it easier for people to make payments using digital currencies and they hope to really work alongside banks.</p>
<p>They actually run on the same premise as Ripple, and the way in which Ripple has gained in popularity in the last year has also had a profound impact on the price of the Stellar digital currency as well. An interesting point to make is that the price per token is substantially lower than you may have expected from a cryptocurrency that is riding high, but then it did start off exceptionally low giving it room to move without pricing itself out of the market. If you are new to investing in cryptocurrencies, then this could very well become one of the best ones to start off with.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> IOTA.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One thing that you have to say about IOTA is that it does have the ability to effectively look into the future with what it is able to offer. By focusing on the Internet of Things, which is an area that is just becoming even more popular than ever before, it means that they have been able to find their niche and have capitalized on it accordingly. The token itself has seen a price increase in the region of 1000% in recent times, which is pretty impressive all on its own, and it is a price that is only going to continue to increase in value in the near future.</p>
<p>The fact that people are able to transfer payments on their system with zero fees is seriously impressive, and that is just one of many features that both the token and platform in general is able to offer you. With a focus on both micro and nano transactions, IOTA is able to carve out its market and is well on its way to dominating it accordingly.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Litecoin.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Created by an ex-Google engineer back in 2011, this was viewed as being a better alternative to what Bitcoin was offering, and even though it has not reached the heights of Bitcoin, there’s no doubt that Litecoin has still been able to grab a substantial share of the market.</p>
<p>This coin seeks to undo the problems that surround Bitcoin by offering higher coin limits, faster transaction times and lower fees. It is a cryptocurrency in the truest sense of the word as it does not seek to run a blockchain platform like Ethereum. However, with the price continuing to increase, Litecoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that you should seriously consider investing in over the next 12 months.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> NEO.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This cryptocurrency is based in China and it seeks to offer what they call a ‘smart economy’ which sounds way more complicated than it actually is. Also, it is looking at dealing with digital assets as well as digitizing physical ones that can then be traded via digital means and without there being any need for a third-party to be involved.</p>
<p>The best thing about Neo is that the cryptocurrency has not really suffered from the volatile nature of so many cryptocurrencies and its price has been relatively steady as a result. With a market value in excess of $6 billion, it is growing fast and shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there for you to choose from when you are looking at investing, but we believe that the six mentioned above are well worth checking out as they are not only relatively stable but also tend to represent value for money as well. Of course, there’s no way that you can guarantee that the price will not drop at some point, but as long as you are looking for the long-term investment then these options could be the best way to go.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is little doubt that Youtube is a pretty impressive place to visit if you are searching for some advice and useful information related to cryptocurrencies. After all, there are a whole host of ‘experts’ that have uploaded a wide array of videos covering a variety of subjects, so thee is always something rather interesting to find if you are willing to spend the time checking it out.</p>
<p><span id="more-73"></span></p>
<p>However, we want to make things a bit easier for you, so here are just some of the key people that we believe you should check out.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-74 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/youtube_crypto.png" alt="" width="1027" height="607" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/youtube_crypto.png 1027w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/youtube_crypto-300x177.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/youtube_crypto-768x454.png 768w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/youtube_crypto-1024x605.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> In It For The Money.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This channel belongs to a Danish guy who just does not come across as being the usual kind of person you would follow on Youtube. However, do not allow the smart dressing to put you off because what he offers you is some pretty straightforward advice on a wide range of subjects related to digital currencies. Yes, he states that he has made some pretty impressive gains during his time as a trader, but it is the way in which he offers tips and advice that makes this a great channel.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> DJ Naydee.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Even though his channel is now about cryptocurrencies, this guy did start off as a DJ. Not only does he seek to make the entire thing as entertaining as possible, but he will always seek to explain things in terms that anybody will be able to understand. This in itself is pretty cool simply because he does make life so much easier and it will generally lead to you feeling as if you are in a better position to make the correct decisions with your own investments.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> The Cryptoniac.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The main focus of this channel is in checking out different ICO options, and they follow a tried and tested formula and structure with each video. This does make it easier for you to work out which ICO you should follow next, and he is not afraid to give his own personal opinions as to whether or not this will ultimately be successful which is like a breath of fresh air when others simply take the company line.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> The Modern Investor.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This guy is pretty prolific when it comes to the videos that he is able to produce and if you are looking for a channel that is going to dig deep into the news that surrounds the industry, then this could very well be the correct place for you. Throughout his videos, he covers each and every aspect of the crypto world from coins to mining and everything in between . However, he does so in a simplistic manner meaning each and every video can be enjoyed by everyone even those that are relatively new to this entire industry.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Data Dash.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This channel is one of the most popular cryptocurrency channels that exists on Youtube, and it is pretty easy to see why as soon as you start to check out the different videos that appear on their channel. With news, interviews, tips and guidance, the owner of the channel is actually very well respected in the industry meaning you can really trust the advice and information that he gives. Also, he avoids making things as complex as they can sometimes be which is always a bonus.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Young and Investing.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t allow the name to fool you or put you off checking out this channel as that would be a huge mistake on your part. His videos consist of looking at ICOs, news, and he is also not afraid to refer to things as being a scam if he is not that happy with what he is seeing. This is something that he has done before with very positive results, so you should find no problem in believing everything that he has to say even if you are not completely convinced in the process.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> BTC Business Consult.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This guy called Andreas is not as well known as some of the other people on Youtube in this industry, but that doesn’t mean that he is unable to provide some amazing pieces of information because that is certainly not the case. His main focus is on those coins that offer dividends or payouts which is a niche market, but one that is still important and is worth checking out. The cool thing is that he goes into some detail with the various payouts so you know where you stand at all times.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Hyper Change TV.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This channel covers not only the world of cryptocurrency but also the stock market in general although the videos that they produce on digital currency and the blockchain are always of a high standard. Presented by a guy called Gali, he is certainly enthusiastic about his topics and this comes across loud and clear in each video. He prefers to look at the long-term game with the various investments so if you are wanting advice on how to make fast money, then this is not the guy for you.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> Crypto Gurus.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This channel is fronted by two English guys and they are making a name for themselves for offering some of the most in-depth reviews of the various ICOs that are hitting the scene today. They will also spend a considerable amount of time studying the economics of various tokens providing you with a more stable picture of what to do next. However, don’t worry as they keep it simple even though they are dealing with complex issues.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> The Crypto Lark.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Crypto Lark is an American who currently resides in New Zealand, and he is viewed by many as being the best on Youtube for cryptocurrency news and reviews. His videos are quite laid-back even though he has a tendency to go in deep with his reviews and analysis but by the end of it all he does lay it all out on the line as to why a certain coin or ICO is good or bad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There can be little doubting the potential power of Reddit in so many industries, and cryptocurrency is going to be no different. If you check out the website, then you will see that there are various sections that are dedicated to various aspects of the world of cryptocurrency, and it all makes for some pretty impressive reading for anybody that is interested in learning more about this industry.</p>
<p><span id="more-68"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-69 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/reddit_crypto.png" alt="" width="1262" height="855" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/reddit_crypto.png 1262w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/reddit_crypto-300x203.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/reddit_crypto-768x520.png 768w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/reddit_crypto-1024x694.png 1024w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/reddit_crypto-1200x813.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>However, it has to be said that not every section is going to be to the same high standard, so it’s important to work out which ones are not only worth paying attention to, but also worth avoiding. Hopefully this short list is going to make life a lot easier.</p>
<p><strong>R/cryptocurrency.</strong></p>
<p>With well in excess of 600,000 subscribers, this is one of the busier groups on this subject that exists on Reddit. Here, you will find discussions on every single aspect of cryptocurrency as well as people sharing news items connected to the industry from around the world. However, the general atmosphere is one that is more laid-back than you would perhaps expect but in amongst it is a lot of rather useful information that you will be able to put to good use.</p>
<p><strong>R/Bitcoin.</strong></p>
<p>This name is pretty self-explanatory as to what the subreddit is all about, and with it having over 750,000 subscribers it does also mean that there is quite a lot of discussions taking place at any given time. You can also guarantee that if there’s any news on Bitcoin from anywhere in the world that this is the place where it will be picked up and shared almost instantly. They also talk about the potential future of the currency as well which is always going to be useful information to pick up.</p>
<p><strong>R/Ethereum.</strong></p>
<p>Just like the Bitcoin version, this subreddit focuses on Ethereum, and it too is rather popular with over 340,000 subscribers joining in. The discussions that take place in this subreddit can become rather technical in their approach but do not allow that to put you off checking it out. You will also find explanations as well as a huge amount of news connected to Ethereum, so this is well worth a look.</p>
<p><strong>R/BTC.</strong></p>
<p>This subreddit actually came about because some people were annoyed at the way in which the other Bitcoin place was being run which ultimately led to this offshoot happening. This is seen as being far more open to additional discussions and it has around 200,000 subscribers which is still pretty impressive stuff. This is certainly more laid-back than some of the other groups, but it is still capable of having a number of important discussions that will help you with your investments.</p>
<p><strong>R/gpumining.</strong></p>
<p>With a main focus on GPU mining, this subreddit is going to help you to better understand the options that are available to you if you plan on mining coins and everything that comes with it. Not only will there be a substantial amount of advice and tips on what to do in order to maximise the potential, they will also cover an array of alt-coins where mining can indeed take place. If you are relatively new to this concept, then this could be a wonderful place to check out.</p>
<p><strong>R/ethermining.</strong></p>
<p>Just like the previous subreddit, this group focuses on the potential of mining for Ether and everything connected to it. Within this group you will be completely free to ask any questions that you may have surrounding the practice and with a number of experts making up the subscriber numbers, then there is a pretty good chance that you will be in a position to get the kind of answers that you were seeking.</p>
<p><strong>R/Crypto_Currency_News</strong></p>
<p>This is yet another subreddit where the name of the group is pretty self-explanatory. Being aware of the range of news connected to the industry does make a significant difference to your future investments and you will find that this group has its finger on the pulse of what is happening in the industry in general. They also look at the new coins that are coming out and the way in which they can have an impact on the price of others allowing you to better understand what you should do next.</p>
<p><strong>R/CryptoCurrencyTrading.</strong></p>
<p>This group offers wide-ranging discussions on all kinds of altcoins and the best way to then go ahead and trade in them making it a useful place to go for those new at trading in digital currencies. You will also find discussions on the main coins that everybody is aware of, so it is certainly worth your while looking at the list of discussions in this subreddit as you never know what you are going to be able to find on there.</p>
<p><strong>R/Altcoin.</strong></p>
<p>With a real focus on altcoins and everything to do with them, this subreddit is going to be able to open your eyes up to a number of coins that you perhaps never even knew existed up until this point. There is also a balance of both novices and experts in the group so you can expect discussions at various levels as well as the opportunity to ask a number of questions on a wide array of subjects.</p>
<p><strong>R/CryptoTechnology.</strong></p>
<p>If you are on the lookout for a serious group that is focused on options with crypto technology, then this is the correct place for you. No price posts and basically no fun is allowed as this is more to do with the absolute serious nature of crypto trading and the direction in which it finds itself heading.</p>
<p>Reddit has a huge number of groups that are dedicated to cryptocurrency, and we have only sought to highlight a few of them to provide you with a sense of what is out there. Of course, you may prefer some over others, but at least there are options dedicated to individual coins as well as trading in general which is never going to be a bad thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With it being well-known for its use of technology, it should be no surprise that there are a number of cryptocurrency exchanges that are based in South Korea. After all, they have a tendency to be at the absolute forefront of changes in technology, so doing something such as this is well within their retinue.</p>
<p><span id="more-65"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-66 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance.png" alt="" width="948" height="745" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance.png 948w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance-300x236.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance-768x604.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>However, perhaps the most surprising thing of all is that not every South Korean cryptocurrency exchange is actually that well known to the public. As a result, they are not as active as you may have expected with this being true especially in comparison with a number of the other exchanges that have garnered together a more stellar reputation.</p>
<p>That being said, we believe that these four currency exchanges are well worth checking out even though, as you will see, they do tend to have a few limitations that could have a negative impact on your overall experience with them.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Yapizon.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing that is going to surprise you about Yapizon is that it has been around for a number of years even though it is really not that well known. Its main focus is on Bitcoins although that alone was almost their un-doing since a number of Bitcoins were stolen from it some time ago, and you certainly do not want your security brought into questioning when you are a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>In actual fact, it is believed that the sum of coins lost was around 3,000 and the company was then forced into changing the balances of their clients to then go ahead and address that particular loss. The fact that they did this does show that they are an honest company and exchange with them also creating a rewards program to try and help to compensate those individuals that were negatively affected by the loss.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Coinone.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Coinone is another cryptocurrency exchange that has really not managed to gain too much traction over the years. It focuses on three key markets, Bitcoin, Ethereum and also Ethereum Classic so there is certainly more than enough scope for the exchange to operate in. However, they appear to have rather limited themselves by organizing that the cryptocurrencies can only be traded against the Korean Won rather than being traded with one another. This may very well be a reason why it has struggled to gain a significant foothold compared to others although it is still known to be trading in a perfectly reasonable volume on a daily basis.</p>
<p>What is clear is that Coinone has to look at potentially including other fiat currencies as well as those digital currencies if it is to expand and gain new followers as a matter of urgency.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Korbit.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Korbit cryptocurrency exchange is actually one of the oldest that has been created within South Korea. Furthermore, it has taken its time to build up its reputation with it being seen as being a solid exchange and one that can undoubtedly be trusted. However, part of this reputation was due to it being one of the first exchanges that offered trading between Bitcoin and the Korean Won, so we should perhaps not read that much into it all.</p>
<p>The good thing about this exchange is that they did move away from just looking at Bitcoin and decided to include both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic to their list. Just trading in these three cryptocurrencies appears to be relatively common within South Korean exchanges, but that could very well be something that is going to change in the future and as cryptocurrencies become more acceptable in society.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Korbit does also have several other currencies available, such as LTC and Monero but they do tend to keep that news pretty quiet and you have to search for information on it all. Oh, and you will generally find that they do stick to only trading with the fiat currency rather than with one another which is always going to be a problem.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Bithumb.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Even though this is perhaps one of the cryptocurrency exchanges that you are least likely to have heard of, there have been some significant moves with this trading option in recent times. In actual fact, it has now become one of the key exchanges in South Korea and it seems to have been able to do that from practically out of nowhere. They deal in Bitcoin, which is the main basis of their trading, as well as Ethereum and also Litecoin with those two cryptocurrencies also able to generate a pretty impressive daily trading limit as well. Also, it is known that the trading volume that they are dealing with is continuing to grow on a weekly basis, so they must be doing something correct in order to achieve this.</p>
<p>However, as with all of the others, there are limitations even though they do have additional trading pairs that you are not going to see anywhere else with a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. If they can continue to add more then there is every reason to suspect that Bithumb will only go from strength to strength and continue to dominate the market.</p>
<p>The one thing that is clear from just these four different exchanges based in South Korea is that they are perhaps not as fluid or open to trading than those that come from other parts of the world. That should not put you off potentially checking them out as everything does work smoothly so there should really be no complaints at all.</p>
<p>However, they are rather insular in their approach, and there are so many other exchanges out there that deal with additional pairings and offer a wider range of cryptocurrencies that should really draw in the crowds away from the four mentioned above. Overall, there is no doubt that they do have a significant role to play in the development of digital currencies in the country, and if they can cover those additional areas then they could play a dominant role across Asia and not just in the country.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to trading in cryptocurrency, then one of the key things is in being able to get the correct information and trading tips that can then make a difference to the potential profits that you are able to make. This information can be sourced from a number of different avenues, but at this moment in time we will focus on just one, Twitter.</p>
<p><span id="more-62"></span></p>
<p>Yes, in amongst all of the crazy things that go on in Twitterland, there are some cryptocurrency accounts that we believe you just have to follow if you are serious about making progress with trading these altcoins. So, who should you follow? Well, these 10 accounts would be a great place to start.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-63 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/top_crypto_twitter.png" alt="" width="918" height="564" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/top_crypto_twitter.png 918w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/top_crypto_twitter-300x184.png 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/top_crypto_twitter-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Venture Coinist.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This account belongs to Luke Martin who is a blockchain innovator and a guy that seriously knows what he is doing with cryptocurrency. The account is linked to his trading group, called Venture Coinist, and his main reasoning for having the account is to give out news and tips on how to get on in the world of cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> CryptoHustle.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>CryptoHustle is the Twitter account for an individual that is a full-time trader in cryptocurrencies. He has the habit of throwing out some topics for conversation as well as news and tips that you can follow if you wish to do so.

<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Crypto de Medici.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This isn’t the account of the once wealth Italian family, but just a general account that focuses on cryptocurrency trading and helping you to effectively start trading and it all being a more positive experience. It focuses on offering snippets of useful tips and information that are designed to just make understanding the entire industry that bit easier to do. If you are looking for something more in-depth, then this is not the place to come.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Bitcoin Benny.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Benny is a full-on cryptocurrency trader, and his Twitter account contains various pieces of information, his advice, and also a plethora of reviews. The best part is that he is able to offer this advice without allowing it all to drown in a sea of complicated language that ultimately leaves you feeling more confused than ever before. If you want things to be straight down the middle, then this is the account to follow.</p>
<ol start="5">

</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li><strong> ZeusZissou.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As part of the USC Investment Group, this Twitter account is a place to check out if you are seeking some pretty level-headed advice from someone that has their finger firmly on the pulse of the cryptocurrency world. Not only that, but the advice that they give out is absolutely golden without it being too complex to understand, which is always a bonus. You will get educational resources, taught what to do, insights into the different markets and a whole lot more that you can then put to good use with your own attempts at trading cryptocurrency.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> CryptoTutor.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This name is pretty self-explanatory in what they hope to do via their Twitter account. This guy is both an economist and an analyst with a firm grasp on what is going on in the cryptocurrency world at any given time. Not only that, but he is on a quest to educate people and to help them to better understand the entire industry, which can only be a good thing for you. His main focus is on altcoins, and his Tweets consist of information on airdrops, charts, events and coins to look out for, so there is always going to be something that is of use to you.</p>
<ol start="8">

</ol>
<p>This account belongs to Charles Hoskinson who is the CEO of IOHK which is a company that builds both the blockchain and cryptocurrencies. At one point, he was also the CEO of Ethereum, so this is a guy that knows everything that there is to know about this technology.

<ol start="9">

</ol>
<p>The Coin-Shark account has a very specific reason for it existing in that it aims to help to guide you through the various issues and absolute trash that exists in the cryptocurrency world.

<ol start="10">
<li><strong> Crypto_Skipper.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Crypto_Skipper is a Twitter account that is going to help you to understand the various charts and graphs that effectively plague the world of cryptocurrency. For those that are new to all of this kind of thing, these charts can often be rather confusing and perplexing to make sense of them, so that is where this account will prove to be useful. Thanks to the Tweets, you will have a better understanding of the various trends and how to then react to them.</p>
<p>These 10 Twitter accounts are by no means the only ones that are out there but they are certainly some of the names that you need to be paying close attention to wherever possible. They cover a number of angles in the cryptocurrency industry and there’s no doubt that they will help to clear up a number of the different problems and issues that you may very well have prior to making your investment decision. Considering it is all free to follow them, then failing to do so makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of cryptocurrency has certainly come under significant scrutiny in recent times, and as a result there’s no doubt that the number of individuals that are seeking to get involved in cryptocurrency trading is on the increase. However, with that there is a very real problem in that those newcomers are in danger of making some costly mistakes if they do not take the appropriate course of action. Considering there is money involved, this is clearly not something that you want to be doing.</p>
<p><span id="more-59"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-60 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/crypto_noob.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="442" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/crypto_noob.jpg 700w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/crypto_noob-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So, what do you do? Well, there are some things that will make a significant difference if you are indeed new to this form of trading and will help you to smooth what could potentially be a difficult and rough path. To help, we are going to examine what we perceive to be the top 5 tips for newcomers in cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Take Notice of the Supply of the Currency in Circulation.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you are starting out with cryptocurrency, you can find yourself being rather easily drawn into believing that a coin that is on the market for next to nothing is going to prove to be a wonderful investment as it will surely increase in value? Well, even though that can happen, there’s no doubt that there are a whole host of other reasons as to why it is priced so low.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons is connected to the sheer number of coins that are in circulation, which is why you need to look at the supply to determine if it is actually being undervalued. If there are billions of coins out there, then the chances of the price going up will be relatively small unless something crazy happens.</p>
<p>However, if the supply is low, then this can push the price up as it becomes a rarer commodity, so keep an eye out for this before you go ahead and invest.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Avoid a Clear Price Spike.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>People can see that a coin has surged in value and think that they should then go ahead and invest as the price is spiking. However, it is either going to drop back down or plateau meaning you will be unable to make the kind of profit that you were initially hoping for.</p>
<p>If you jump in, then there is a pretty good chance that you will end up losing money but even with that there is another issue that you need to be aware of. That issue is the way in which people that are new to this form of trading will then see that the price is dropping and sell their coins in a panic. Their intention is to get back some of their initial outlay, but even this is the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>So, avoid that price spike and it will stop you from encountering a whole host of issues and problems.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Does the Coin Have a Use?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Prior to any investment, it will be worth your while to ask yourself one key question, does the coin have a use? What this means is you spend some time ascertaining if the coin is linked to a service or product that people would want to use because without this there will be no demand for the coin.</p>
<p>Also, you need to look at whether or not there are a number of other coins out there on the market offering the same thing as this will also have an impact on the end price. Furthermore, is the coin linked to something that is actually tangible and either in operation or close to it? You would be amazed at how many companies launch their ICO and yet you are looking at some 18 months, or longer, before anything happens.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Know What You Can Afford.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the absolute golden rule of any investment. Failing to know what you can afford is just going to open you up to a number of potential problems and you ultimately digging a rather large hole for yourself. There are so many stories of people putting even their homes at risk just to invest in a cryptocurrency as they have been caught up in the hype surrounding it but there is a substantial chance that you could end up losing everything.</p>
<p>You should only ever invest money that you know you can afford to lose without it having a negative impact on other areas of your life. Avoid being caught up in the excitement surrounding an altcoin and invest smaller amounts if it means that you will be more financially secure by the end of it all. Also consider saving up some cash to then invest over a longer period of time as an alternative option.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Being Able to Diversify is Key.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is all fair and well having a certain cryptocurrency that you feel you understand more and are willing to dedicate your time investing in it and trading in the coin, but that is not the correct way to go about this industry. Instead, it will prove to be more beneficial to you to diversify your investments and to take advantage of a number of different coins rather than focusing on just the one.</p>
<p>Consider taking profit from one coin and putting it into an altcoin that is building up a healthy track record. Over time, you will notice that your portfolio is growing and spreading with it having the ability to help you through rough times when one coin dips as others in your portfolio will be soaring.</p>
<p>Getting started in cryptocurrency trading can be a scary thought, but as long as you have a willingness to learn more about the industry and how it all works, then there is no doubt that there is the very real possibility of making a profit. However, you are going to make mistakes at different times, but it will be how you react to them and rectify them that will prove to be the most important point of all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to a cryptocurrency exchange, then it makes sense for you to spend a considerable amount of time checking out the various options that are available before you go ahead and start to trade in your digital currency of choice. If you spend any time looking at what is available online, then you will see that there are indeed a range of websites and platforms that can offer this kind of service.</p>
<p><span id="more-56"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-57 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_bittrex.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_bittrex.jpg 1280w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_bittrex-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_bittrex-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_bittrex-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/binance_bittrex-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Two of the main cryptocurrency exchanges that are available are Binance and Bittrex, but as they are two of the key options, then it does mean that we should look at both to try to determine which one is best. After all, it can make a huge difference to your ability to carry out the trades in the first place, and who doesn’t want things to go as smoothly as possible?</p>
<p><strong>Looking at the Two Exchanges.</strong></p>
<p>To make life easier, we can give a brief overview of both exchanges to help us with our decision. What you will see is that there are a number of similarities between the two. For example, neither of them offer the option to exchange fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies even though that does have the potential of being something that could change later on.</p>
<p>Also, it is fair to say that neither exchange is going to be suitable for the individual that is just starting out in this industry. Their interfaces are rather complex, and even though they do provide a substantial amount of information, it is often information that a novice would simply look at and fail to grasp the importance of what they were seeing.</p>
<p><strong>The Currencies they Support.</strong></p>
<p>Another key area to look at has to be the different currencies that they support since that is going to be one of the things that will draw you into using the exchange in the first place. With this, what we see is that Bittrex does have the upper hand as they provide over 200 different cryptocurrencies, and while Binance does fall short of this number, they do still offer way more options than most of the other exchanges out there.</p>
<p>However, Binance does open up a number of different projects compared to what is on offer from Bittrex. On the flip side, it does seem to be the case that Binance has the ability to list cryptocurrencies way before other exchanges, which has to be a huge bonus and is a huge reason why traders will often focus on what they are doing to hopefully get in on the act at an earlier point.</p>
<p><strong>Tokens and Non-Tokens.</strong></p>
<p>One area where there is a difference between the two is in the production of their own token. With this, it is simple to understand as Binance has produced its very own token whereas Bittrex is still lagging behind in this department.</p>
<p>The token that Binance has created is used in trading pairs with a number of the other major cryptocurrencies on their platform, which will prove to be rather useful. Also, if you use the token that they have created then you are also going to end up saving yourself a substantial amount of money with the actual fees as they are greatly reduced when you take this option.</p>
<p><strong>The People Behind it.</strong></p>
<p>When you are looking at either an exchange, platform or cryptocurrency, it will often prove to be rather useful to know who is behind the project and what their general experience is within the industry. When you do this, what you see between Binance and Bittrex are two completely different approaches.</p>
<p>Bittrex is pretty secretive about who is behind it all, which is not exactly a good thing for building confidence in your product or service. There is limited information available whereas Binance has had their owner on TV news channels and they project the image of being a company that cares about the people that are using their service.</p>
<p>This is also seen in the way that they deal with customer support. Bittrex has kind of built a reputation for not being that strong in this area whereas Binance is doing the complete opposite. Not only are they fast to deal with any issues, but they are also seen as being very thorough in their methods and ways in which they resolve any problems.</p>
<p><strong>Signing Up and Using it.</strong></p>
<p>For signing up, then both options are completely equal with one another as there is nothing complex and it literally does just take minutes. Also, both have suspended new registrations at different times, so once again we can say that they are level.</p>
<p>They are also pretty well matched when it comes to using their interface as both are seen by many as being slightly cumbersome and difficult to use. They are certainly not a good option for those that are new to cryptocurrency trading, so if you are a novice, then other options would be better.</p>
<p><strong>Money.</strong></p>
<p>Both exchanges offer the same level of service for both depositing and withdrawing money. They offer a number of digital wallets as an option and even the time it takes is pretty well matched. However, Bittrex does have a higher fee at 0.25% while Binance varies from 0.05% to 0.1% so it is clear as to who wins at that point.</p>
<p><strong>So, Who is the Winner?</strong></p>
<p>When you add everything together, then both exchanges have their positives while also lacking in other areas. Ultimately, it is your decision as to which one you prefer, so you may wish to experience both in order to help with that decision.</p>
<p>However, if you had to choose one, then we would tend to lean towards Binance, and that is primarily because of their token and its ability to reduce fees. Anything that does not have a negative impact on your user experience and saves you money in the process has to be a major positive, and Binance achieves exactly that. Also, it is regarded by many as being the hottest exchange at this moment in time, but who knows how that will change in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using the pump and dump method in order to make money from altcoins is certainly becoming more popular, and when you look at the profit that can be made, then it is pretty obvious as to why this is the case. However, even though it is cool to look at a way that is going to almost guarantee that you make cash, there is still a sense of being required to understand the methodology behind the approach so you can then put the correct things into action.</p>
<p><span id="more-53"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-54 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pump_group.png" alt="" width="643" height="344" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pump_group.png 643w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pump_group-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Perhaps the best part in all of this is that it is very easy to follow even if you are relatively new to the entire cryptocurrency trading idea. In fact, all that is going to be required from your side of the bargain is the ability to really follow some simple instructions and to be alert when the pump and dump is happening. Now, if you feel that you can indeed achieve that, then you are going to be onto quite a good thing here.</p>
<p><strong>The Basics of a Pump and Dump.</strong></p>
<p>Just before we go into an example of how the entire thing works, let’s provide a quick and straightforward explanation as to the absolute basics of the pump and dump option.</p>
<p>Basically, you have a group of people that work in tandem with one another who then go ahead and select an altcoin that they wish to target. This is all co-ordinated from the very beginning to make sure that everyone is working from the same point.</p>
<p>At an agreed time, everyone in the pump and dump group will go ahead and purchase as much of those coins as they can, at which point the price is going to clearly skyrocket as the traders out there suddenly realize that this altcoin is hot at this moment. Thanks to this, they then start to purchase the coins as well which keeps pushing the price up even higher as people try to get in on this movement.</p>
<p>However, that all comes to an end when, at an agreed time, everyone in the group that has bought the altcoin will then sell it, and because of the sheer mass of coins being sold, it brings the price back down by a substantial amount. That is the part that is referred to as the dump as the altcoin is effectively being dumped back on the open market.</p>
<p>In other words, a pump and dump group will be able to artificially enhance the value of an altcoin and then drop it back down, and by doing this action they are then able to make money from the trade in a way that we are going to explain in a bit more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at an Example.</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way to really explain how you are able to make money from pump and dump with altcoins is to check out an actual example. By doing so, you can see the difference that the process makes as well as then being in a position to notice where the profit is made by those involved in the group.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the $AMZN altcoin was at the focal point of a pump and dump approach. At an agreed time, people bought a substantial volume of the coin which saw the price increase by a significant percentage. You can even see the difference in the value in the chart to get a better understanding of the way in which the pump and dump can have a major impact on the price of the altcoin.</p>
<p>What the image also shows is the absolute drop in value when the dump occurred, and this is a perfect example of what goes on with each and every altcoin that is handled in this way. In fact, the drop-off with this example is not even as severe as it has been with other altcoins on the market.</p>
<p><strong>How the Profit is Made.</strong></p>
<p>So, how is the profit made? Why is this such a lucrative approach for so many people that are looking to make fast money with cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>To understand things better, we can look at that price per token as that is going to be the key. People simply buy the altcoin at a low price, but because we are talking about a huge number of coins being purchased in a short blast, then the price increases as you see in the graph. The pump could last for 5 minutes, 20 minutes, hours, or a day as it always pushes up the price of the altcoin.</p>
<p>As the price has been increased, it then makes sense for those involved in the pump to then sell the coins en-masse. In doing so, they keep the difference in value that they have artificially achieved, and when you are talking about a huge number of coins, then this can ultimately turn into a healthy profit. Also, with a number of these events happening every week, you can start to see how it can turn into a good money making process for anybody that is involved in the action.</p>
<p>With all of this, the main thing is in being able to just follow the instructions that are being passed on by the people behind the decision as to which altcoin is going to be targeted and when it is going to happen. As long as you can do that, then there should be no problems whatsoever and you can really then see how it can ultimately prove to be difficult not to make money from a pump and dump group.</p>
<p>The key is in getting into the correct group and being part of the process from the voting as to which coin will be targeted to how long the pump should last for. As long as you have money to spend on purchasing the initial coins, then you seriously have nothing to lose, and how many money making ideas out there can you actually say that about?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At first, you may be forgiven for thinking that it is very easy to spot a crypto pump and dump scheme as the signs should be there in clear view. After all, part of the approach of the scheme is to encourage more people to purchase the altcoin that they are targeting since this pushes up the price of the coin and they make more profit.</p>
<p><span id="more-50"></span></p>
<p>However, even though this is true, you clearly want to get in on the act as early as possible. Alternatively, you might also want to be able to spot one to avoid being caught up in the rush and panic to purchase the coin in question only to then discover that you have had your fingers burnt by simply not paying attention.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-51 aligncenter" src="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="534" srcset="https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc.jpg 720w, https://bigpumpgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/btc-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><strong>What is a Pump and Dump Scheme?</strong></p>
<p>Before going into how you identify this scheme, a brief explanation as to what we mean by a pump and dump scheme is going to be in order. After all, how are you going to be able to identify it if you have no idea what it is that we are talking about?</p>
<p>The easiest way to explain all of this is that it is a type of trading whereby the market is manipulated for the benefit of those individuals, or companies, that are involved in the scheme. This is not something that is unique to cryptocurrency trading as it has been around for decades with a main focus on the equities market, but it has certainly taken hold in this particular market.</p>
<p>The quick explanation is that a pump and dump scheme in connection with cryptocurrency trading involves a group of people working together to artificially boost the value of a particular altcoin. They purchase a significant number of coins at the same time with this causing the value to increase quite considerably with this being known as the pump.</p>
<p>Once they have achieved their target price, which is agreed in advance, everyone in the scheme sells the coins, which means they are effectively dumping them back on the market. This will then drive the price in a downward spiral with the people in the group making a substantial profit.</p>
<p><strong>How to Identify a Pump and Dump Scheme.</strong></p>
<p>In order to identify a pump and dump scheme, the key is to be able to understand the trading charts for the various altcoins that are on a number of different exchanges. This is where you will be able to spend time studying the rise and fall of the various altcoins because that is how you can begin to spot some rather not so subtle changes in the values.</p>
<p>Often, you will be able to identify an altcoin that was previously unknown suddenly increase in value quite substantially and for no apparent reason. Indeed, there are some coin price charts that set in rates whereby there are triggers when a coin suddenly increases in price by more than 5% in 5 minutes. When this happens, the coin in question can then appear on a list as potentially being involved in a pump and dump scheme.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only way in which you are able to identify a potential pump and dump scheme.</p>
<p>The other common method is to pay close attention to certain news stories, and not the normal kind that come from real writers or journalists. Instead, we are talking about paid for stories that have a very specific reasoning behind their very existence.</p>
<p>Often, the coins that they focus on have a relatively small cap but the appearance of the story is then able to coincide with a significant upsurge in activity on social media networks and platforms. This can result in a small coin making a huge impact on the likes of Twitter and Facebook with profiles and groups all talking about this coin that has, up until this moment, managed to achieve very little at all.</p>
<p>Finally, if you realize that a particular altcoin that was small has actually managed to capitalize on the market, and it has absolutely no right to achieve this, then there is a pretty good chance that it has been pushed by artificial and fake methods.</p>
<p><strong>Offering Some Protection from these Schemes.</strong></p>
<p>So, we have shown how you can identify these schemes, but then how do you go ahead and protect yourself from them? Well, this is actually easier than you think, and it is all connected to the way in which you go about your business of trading in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>A main point is that there is a significant focus on coins that generally have a much lower trading volume. That is because they can be easily manipulated and the price can increase without much work. Also, when you study those charts and see that the price is soaring, then it is up to you as to whether or not you then want to go ahead and get involved in purchasing that coin knowing full well that the price will crash at any moment.</p>
<p>However, perhaps the best piece of advice when trying to identify a pump and dump scheme is to make sure that you do your research before you take action, and this applies no matter the side of the fence that you are on. Of course, it is entirely up to you to determine if you wish to participate in the pump and dump scheme.</p>
<p>As you can see, being able to identify these schemes is a lot easier than you may have previously been aware. As long as you can spend some time studying the markets and paying close attention to the movement of various coins, then you should get to a point where you can identify these pump and dump schemes even if you are not a member of the group yourself. Of course, as you see the profits that they can make then it may propel you into joining in because at least then you will be on the inside rather than simply standing back and watching what is going on.</p>
